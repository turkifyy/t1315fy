Real Madrid forward Rodrygo Goes, more often than not, delivers for the team on the big nights in the UEFA Champions League.

The 24-year-old ace seems to save his best for Europe’s premier football competition and will, thus, have a key role to play on Wednesday when Los Blancos take on neighbours Atletico Madrid in the Round-of-16 second leg.


Ahead of the big game in a couple of days, Rodrygo spoke with UEFA’s official media, discussing his special bond with the Champions League and the Euroderbi among several other things.

On the Champions League
Kicking things off, Rodrygo spoke about his form and performances in the Champions League, saying:

“I usually say that the Champions League is a competition that I love and in which I have always done well. It’s special for me because things usually go very well for me.

“I’m having an incredible season in the Champions League and I want to continue to help my team even more.”


The Brazilian international then briefly discussed Real Madrid’s knockout playoff tie against Manchester City, which they won in a resounding manner, as he said:

“The game against Manchester City was a very important victory, they were a very difficult opponent and we have been playing against them every year.

“The games are always hard fought, difficult for both teams but this year we were much better. We really took control and that has boosted our confidence for the rest of the season.”

As for the Round-of-16 derbies against Atletico Madrid, he noted: “The games against Atletico have a different atmosphere because they are derbies, they are the two biggest teams in the city.

“The atmosphere is usually different and it’s always special to play against them”.

On the team
Rodrygo shares the pitch with two of the best forwards in the game currently in Kylian Mbappe and Vinicius Jr. Talking about how it feels to play with the pair and the connection between them, he said:

“Playing alongside Mbappe and Vini Jr. is very special, it’s a dream to play with great players and be part of that attack.


“Every day we connect more, we know each other better and we play better. This is just the beginning because we still have a beautiful story to write as a trident.”

Talking about the influence of manager Carlo Ancelotti and how the Italian has helped him at Real Madrid, Rodrygo remarked:

“We have a special relationship and he is a person who has helped me a lot since the first day he arrived. I remember the first training sessions and all the advice he gave me.

“What I learn from him in football and what I try to replicate in my personal life is the way he treats people.”</p>
