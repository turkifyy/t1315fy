        <h1 class="my-4">Welcome to the App Download Page</h1>
        <p class="lead">Download our app now and enjoy the best features! Users on Google Workspace Business and Enterprise tiers, as well as customers with a Gemini Education, Gemini Education Premium, or Google One AI Premium plan, are eligible for the new feature. (Users who previously purchased the now-deprecated Gemini Business or Gemini Enterprise add-ons are also eligible.) Admins can enable ‚ÄúAdd to calendar‚Äù by switching on smart features and personalization from the Workspace Admin console.

‚ÄúAdd to calendar‚Äù is only the latest Gemini-powered tool to reach Gmail inboxes. In June 2024, Google added new capabilities to Gmail on the web to help users write emails and summarize email threads, plus ask questions and find specific information from emails within an inbox. Some of those capabilities came to the Gmail apps for iOS and Android toward the end of last year. Both models equip XDR display technology, with the Q10L achieving an impressive 4,500 nits peak brightness, while the Q10L Pro reaches a staggering 6,500 nits. This extreme brightness level ensures vivid highlights and enhanced HDR performance, making content appear more lifelike. The 7,000:1 ultra-high native contrast ratio delivers deep blacks and crisp whites.

For improved clarity and color accuracy, the series comes with Butterfly Wing Brilliance Screen technology and 98% DCI-P3 quantum dot wide color gamut, ensuring true-to-life colors and professional-grade accuracy with ŒîE<0.99. Additionally, it integrates a 0.5% LR low-reflection film, significantly reducing glare and maintaining clarity in bright environments.

The TCL Q10L series equips a 2.2.2 Hi-Fi audio system, developed in collaboration with Onkyo, delivering rich bass, clear dialogue, and immersive surround sound. The Q10L Pro enhances this with independent Atmos channels, offering a more expansive and detailed soundscape.

Both models feature TCL‚Äôs Fuxi AI giant model, an intelligent system that automatically adjusts contrast, brightness, and sharpness based on the displayed content. The TVs further optimize the user experience with Ling Control System 3.0, ensuring a smooth, ad-free startup and personalized content recommendations. The DeepSeek large AI model is also integrated, offering an adaptive and intuitive smart TV interface.

The Q10L series sports an ultra-thin ZeroBorder design, creating a virtually bezel-free display for a more immersive viewing experience. They come with a custom-designed magnetic wall mount, giving the illusion of a floating screen when installed.

The lineup equips HDMI 2.1 ports, supporting high refresh rates of up to 144Hz in 4K resolution and up to 240Hz in lower resolutions, making it ideal for next-generation gaming consoles. They support Variable Refresh Rate (VRR) and Auto Low Latency Mode (ALLM), ensuring ultra-smooth motion, reduced input lag, and a highly responsive gaming experience.

Pricing and Availability
The TCL Q10L series is competitively priced, with the standard model starting at 5,999 yuan (~$826) and the Q10L Pro from 7,199 yuan (~$992) after subsidies.

Earlier this year, TCL introduced the Thunderbird Q8 Special Edition, a 34-inch Mini LED ultrawide monitor with a 180Hz refresh rate, along with the new Thunderbird 300Hz gaming monitor, which comes at a surprisingly affordable price.</p>
